## What's GoingOn?

There is always a moment that you see many people gathering at a place but have no idea what they are doing. GoingOn app is trying to solve this problem! More specifically, GoingOn organizes events on campus and tells the user what is currently happening on campus according to the user's current location.  

Since currently most of the event information on campus are sent by using email list, people who are not on the email list cannot receive the information unless they ask the people who are on the email list. Imagine a situation like this: there will be a public tech talk about computer science and emails about this talk are sent to a list of all computer science major students. As a result, only computer science major students and some of their friends knows about this talk. If there is a person who has not declare major in computer science but very interested in related fields, it would be great if someone can tell him or her about this talk. GoingOn app is trying to be "someone" helping this person to engage more in the fields of his passion. 

There is a website version of GoingOn and a mobile version of GoingOn (hopefully). 

## Target Audience

The target audience of GoingOn is college students for now. If possible, GoingOn app can also be developed for a larger group of audience in the future.

## Features

* Event organizers can log into organization accounts of their organizations to post event information so that users know which organization is hosting the event.
* Users without an organization account can view the information posted on the app but cannot post any events. This feature is designed to avoid messy information board. 
* A map that shows the user's current location and events nearby. 
* Users can bookmark the events they interested. GoingOn can send a notification to the user before the event (email for the website version and notification dialog on mobile version).
* Users can confirm whether they will attend the event, so the organization can know the numbers of participators (if there is a number limit of this event).
* Users can log in and add their interested fields so that GoingOn can send them information about events they might interested in. 

## How is this meet CSC210 requirements

* It is a web application built for modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.
* It uses Ajax and JSON when loading information to the user, Web 2.0 features.
* It uses Google Map and other modern APIs, Web 3.0 features.
* It contains a database of event information.
* It allows users to perform some basic operations such as edit and delete on their account information (add, edit and delete events, personal interest information, etc).

## Beyond

In addition to a website, we are also planning to make a mobile app for this project considering the usage of this web application. Since Android SDK is open source, currently we are planning to develop the app for Android devices. The use of Cordova can also be an option considering the possibility of creating a cross-platform application. Also, we are planning to use some modern APIs to build the user interface, such as Polymer API and Google Material Design Lite.
