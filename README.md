# GoingOn

## What's GoingOn?

There is always a moment that you see many people gathering at a place but have no idea what they are doing. Goingon app is trying to solve this problem! More specifically, GoingOn organizes events on campus and tells the user what is currently happening on campus according to the user's current location.  

Since currently most of the event information on campus are sent by using email list, people who are not on the email list cannot receive the information unless they ask the people who are on the email list. Imagine a situation like this: there will be a public tech talk about computer science and emails about this talk are sent to a list of all computer science major students. As a result, only computer science major students and some of their friends knows about this talk. If there is a person who has not declare major in computer science but very interested in related fields, it would be great if someone can tell him or her about this talk. GoingOn app is trying to be "someone" helping this person to engage more in the fields of his passion. 

There is a website version of GoingOn and a mobile version of GoingOn (hopefully). 

## Target Audience

The target audience of GoingOn is college students for now. If possible, GoingOn app can also be developed for a larger group of audience in the future

## Features

* Event organizers can log into organization accounts of their organizations to post event information so that users know which organization is hosting the event
* Users without an organization account can view the information posted on the app but cannot post any events. This feature is designed to avoid messy information board. 
* A map that shows the user's current location and events nearby. 
* Users can bookmark the events they interested. GoingOn can send a notification to the user before the event (email for the website version and notification dialog on mobile version).
* Users can log in and add their interested fields so that GoingOn can send them information about events they might interested in.
